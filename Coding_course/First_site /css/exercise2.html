  <h1><strong> All about colours</strong></h1>
<p2>This is a page about colours. You need to fix it so that:</p2>
<ul>
  <li>The sections about blue and yellow have 3px solid black borders.</li>
  <li>The 'about blue' has a light blue (#F0F8FF) background.</li>
  <li>The 'about yellow' has a light yellow (#FFEBCD) background.</li>
  <li>The list of points in the 'about blue' section should be in blue text (but the paragraph text shouldn't be).</li>
  <li>The list of points in the 'about yellow' section should be in orange text(but the paragragh text shouldn't be).</li>
  <li>The final item in both colour section lists is the most important. It should be in font size 16px, with font weight bold</li>
  <li>the navigation at the top should have a red background with white text.</li>
</ul>
